Looking at the user's screenshot:

The visible text in the hero section shows:
Line (partially cut off at top): "...и гармоничной жизни"

This means the FIRST line that should be visible is being cut off at the TOP of the viewport.

The full title should be:
Line 1: "РОСТ — практика осознанной" (or possibly "Твой путь к осознанной")
Line 2: "и гармоничной жизни"

But in the screenshot, we can only see the SECOND line, and even that appears to be cut off at the top.

The issue is that the header/navigation is covering the hero title, or the hero section is positioned too high up on the page, causing the first line to be hidden behind the fixed header.

Need to check:
1. Is the header fixed/sticky?
2. What is the z-index relationship?
3. Is there enough padding-top on the hero section to account for the header height?
